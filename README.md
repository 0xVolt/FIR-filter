## 1.1. About this repository
This minor project in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is to implement a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering application of continuous data in C++ using the concept of a circular buffer. 

The plotting of the filtered continuous data/signal is done in gnuplot in addition to the comparison of the signal before processing and after the FIR filter is applied. This plotting is done by sending data to the gnuplot application with a piping method.

## 1.2. Filtering as a sub-domain of DSP
Filtering is a class of signal processing wherein a device, known as the filter, removes some of the components or features from a signal. The defining feature of filters is the complete or partial suppression of some aspect of the signal inputted to the filter.

The Finite Impulse Response filter is a filter that has a finite impulse response duration. Meaning, the filter will settle to zero at a finite time. A very common application of FIR filter is for removing high frequency noise, that is as a low-pass filter.

## 1.3. Key
### 1.3.1. Signals
In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. Any quantity that can vary over space or time can be used as a signal to share messages between observers. An important property of a signal is its entropy or information content. Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content. The information of a signal is often accompanied by noise, which primarily refers to unwanted modifications of signals, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk). The reduction of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity. The separation of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances. 
### 1.3.2. Signal Processing
Signal processing is an electrical engineering subfield that focuses on analysing, modifying, and synthesizing signals such as sound, images, and scientific measurements. Signal processing techniques can be used to improve transmission, storage efficiency and subjective quality and to also emphasize or detect components of interest in a measured signal. 

### 1.3.3. Putting the Digital in Digital Signal Processing
Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor.
